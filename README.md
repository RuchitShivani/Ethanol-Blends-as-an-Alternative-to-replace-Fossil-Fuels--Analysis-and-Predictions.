# Ethanol Blends as an alternative to fossil fuels

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts renewable energy consumption trends across various countries, taking into account investment trends and historical data. The goal is to understand how financial support and policy measures influence the growth of renewable energy sources that can be implemented
.

## Dataset
- **Primary Data Source**: Global energy datasets from recognised sources such as World Bank.
- **Features Considered**:
  - Historical renewable energy consumption (GWh)
  - Investment trends in renewable energy
  - Country-wise energy policies
  - Economic factors influencing energy adoption

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and handling missing values to ensure an organised dataset.
   - Normalization and transformation of data.
   - Feature engineering to incorporate investment trends.

2. **Model Selection & Training**:
   - Various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) were tested.
   - The best model was selected based on RMSE and accuracy scores.

3. **Forecasting Renewable Energy Consumption**:
   - Short-term and long-term projections were generated.
   - Two scenarios were modeled:
     - **With Investment Trends**: Shows a boost in renewable energy adoption.
     - **Without Investment Trends**: Assumes business-as-usual conditions.

## Results & Analysis
- **Findings**:
  - Countries with aggressive investments (e.g., India, China) show exponential growth in renewable energy adoption.
  - Some nations (e.g., France, Russia) exhibit stagnation or decline when investment trends are not considered.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Policy-driven investments have a **direct impact** on renewable energy growth.
  - Without sustained financial support, energy transition slows down significantly.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, GitHub
